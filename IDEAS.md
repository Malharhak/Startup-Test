This file contains ideas that I am not sure should be in the main checklist or not.

##Project Management

* Do you collect enough [data and user feedback to know what is really important to work on, instead of relying on opinion?

##Programming

* Do you let enough time to your developers to properly perform code reviews? [I think this question is a bit redundant/useless]
